The DriverPass Project
-----------------------

>About the DriverPass Project:

>The DriverPass Project was a two part project, where you first read interview transcripts and gather all the requirements for the DriverPass system. The interview gives you all the needs that the system needs to meet, the purpose of the system, and who the users will be as well as what permissions they will need.  The owner of DriverPass, Liam, states that he wants to be able to assist people in passing their driver tests by having a system that offers courses and practice tests online made with local information from the DMV. The customers or students can also create, edit, and cancel in-person driving reservations with driving instructers to get practice and recieve feedback. He states that the system will need to be and online web-based system that he can access from any device, online or offline, and have access to activity reports and download them to work on them offline. While the boss has full access to the system, the IT Officer, Ian, needs to be able to maintain the system and have access to user accounts to lock/unlock accounts and reset passwords. The secretary will be able to create, modify, and cancel customer reservations and assist in creating customer accounts. The customers, of course, need to be able to do several things from creating an account to purcahsing packages to accessing course material.

> What did I do well? What could I imporve on and how?

>Well, I do find it quite obvious how little experience I have doing all the things that were required of us in this project. Practice makes perfect! I think that I did a good job with the diagrams, as well as my Gantt chart and figuring out all my requirments. I do think that I missed some requirements, which can be fixed by making sure I go over the information 2-3 times, each time adding requirements that I missed the previous time. I also think that my class diagram could use some work, it is definitely the one I need to learn more about. I think that I should have took more notes of the functions of the system and the different users and classes, I think doing that would have helped me a lot with my two documents and my diagrams.
